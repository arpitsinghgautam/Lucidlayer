LucidLayer is an AI-powered Slack assistant designed to make daily communication more engaging, creative, and human. By leveraging IBM's Granite models, LucidLayer simplifies corporate jargon, adds humor, and helps teams express their ideas in a clearer, more accessible manner. Whether you're dealing with boring reports, long emails, or dry presentations, LucidLayer turns the mundane into something more delightful.

## **Hackathon Theme: "Make Work Less Boring"**

**LucidLayer's mission aligns perfectly with the hackathon theme ‚Äî** we aim to *inject creativity into the day-to-day business operations*, reducing the friction and formality of internal communication, and fostering a more innovative, open, and collaborative work environment.

### <a id="project-roadmap"></a>**üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap**

![Project Roadmap](images/lucidlayer_workflow.png)

LucidLayer followed a structured development path from concept to completion:

**Phase 1: Ideation & Planning** - Defined the core problem (overly formal, jargon‚Äëladen internal comms), researched IBM Watsonx Granite foundation models, and set up the project infrastructure.

**Phase 2: Slash Command Prototype** - Implemented the /lucidlayer Flask endpoint, built initial prompt logic for the "simple" rewrite mode, and tested the basic slash‚Äëcommand flow end‚Äëto‚Äëend.

**Phase 3: Text Transformation Modes** - Added Gen‚ÄëZ ("genz") and Humor modes, introduced Corporate mode for professional rewrites, and iteratively refined all prompts based on user feedback.

**Phase 4: Document Annotation** - Enabled DM‚Äëbased file uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT), extracted text using pdfplumber and python‚Äëdocx, and hooked it into granite‚Äë3‚Äë8b‚Äëinstruct for inline comments.

**Phase 5: Code Annotation** - Detected code file types (.py, .js, etc.) in DMs, integrated the granite‚Äë8b‚Äëcode‚Äëinstruct model, and generated inline reviewer notes that both explain and amuse.

**Phase 6: Testing & Refinement** - Added event deduplication, fixed edge‚Äëcase bugs, and tuned model parameters for speed and clarity based on user feedback.

**Phase 7: Deployment & Submission** - Configured Render deployment, updated documentation, and prepared all hackathon deliverables.

### <a id="how-it-works"></a>**üß† How It Works**

1. **Interact via Slack**: Use `/lucidlayer` or DM the bot with text or a file.
2. **Choose a Tone**: Specify a style like "humor", "simple", "corporate", or "genz".
3. **AI-Powered Rewriting**: Content is sent to IBM Granite and rewritten in that tone.
4. **Receive Response**: The revised message or annotated file is returned in Slack.

### <a id="architecture"></a>**üèóÔ∏è Architecture**

![LucidLayer Architecture](images/lucid_layer_architecture.png)

LucidLayer implements a multi-layered architecture that handles the flow from Slack user interactions through to AI-powered responses. The system begins at the Client Layer with the Slack Workspace, which connects to the Slack Integration layer (handling slash commands, events API, and OAuth). The Web Layer uses Flask to process incoming HTTP requests, verified through a Signature Verifier. A Request Dispatcher ensures proper deduplication and async processing, passing requests to the appropriate Business Logic handler (slash commands, DMs, or files). For files, specialized extraction methods handle different formats (PDF, DOCX, code). The AI Inference Layer leverages IBM's Granite models (3-8B-Instruct and 8B-Code-Instruct) with tuned parameters, while the Slack API Client handles responses back to users. The entire system is configured through environment variables and deployed on Render with appropriate monitoring.

### **üß© How to Use on Slack**

1. **Set up**: Install LucidLayer into your Slack workspace by following the integration steps.
2. **Slash Command**: Use the `/lucidlayer` command followed by your message. Optionally, specify a transformation mode (simple, genz, humor, corporate).
3. **Document Upload**: Upload documents or code files, and LucidLayer will provide a witty, simplified, or humorous version.

### **Requirements**

- Slack workspace
- IBM API credentials (Granite model)
